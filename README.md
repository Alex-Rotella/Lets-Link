# Main 
### Deleted unnecessary files
#### At the start of your project before coding, you should have the same exact files and content of the main.

to get the code running on you local machine run npm start from the terminal inside of the file.

if when you run npm start and get an error saying Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported, run the command: export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider in the terminal than rerun npm start.
